# Banking-App
 This is an overview for the whole sprint.
 
 What went well?
 Our team commuinication went well. We have imporved our team collaboration. We have learned a lot about the ionic and angluar,
 which is a new programming language for us. We have gained a lot of experiences and knowledge regarding about the database connection
 and backend data storing. We have leared alot about the frame worka and stuffs. We are now getting used to some of the angular codes
 used on the ionic framework.
 
 What went wrong?
 When we install the node.js for the firebase database connection, we use angularfire2@4.00 which is version 4 of ionic. Since the reference
 we used for our learning was like published 2 years ago. We started coding with version 4. We didn't notice that version 5 was out. We try
 to struggle ourselves with the coding. We do self-learning and continue with our codes. When there is an error, we would just solve it using
 the suggestion given in the visual code. If it is not enough, we would eventully find it on youtube and internet. In one situation, where we
 canot run our app, we go and and edit in the node modules. We just realize that after doing so, we cannot run on other computer, but we do 
 not know whats the main root that is causing this error. We just know yesterday that those fixes were tempoary and there will be a lot of 
 refactoring in order to fix it.Although we work on the code together, we only have one pc that whould run the demo. We are not able to 
 figure out that problem so continue coding and sharing on our own ways. Our main coder codes and we review those codes on 
 github and wrote code on our own. We notice this error's concequences in sprint 7, where the use of codes were different in our money 
 calculation. We show to our senior through github and he try to go through the codes. He then explains the condition that we are in.These situations
 lead us to a dead end that we cannot run our app on other computer even if we get the file from git hub. Morever we cannot continue our 
 coding and also cannot deploy it on a server. Although we know how to deploy it on github.com.io, we cannot continue our project since we
 are in a dead end.
 
 What should we improve in the next sprint?
 
  -Imporovment on time managment and error checking
  -Reading the resources mor eproperly espically the time 
  -Deep learning through the process
